                <span class="lead">Some analysts believe the internet is about connecting people.</span> Is the internet
                being shaped by what people want or is steering our population in certain directions fueled by money. In
                the 90’s sharing music became one of the largest platforms online. The creation of mp3’s made it
                possible to share music online. That largest of these platforms was Napster. Within 1-year millions of
                people were sharing music online which created legal implications with the music industry. This created
                one of the largest legal battles from the internet.
            </p>
            <p>
                Artists and music companies claimed Napster was stealing music by allowing users to share it which
                challenged copyright laws. Ultimately the supreme court ruled Napster violated copyright laws and shut
                them down immediately. This only led to new startups such as Apple Music and YouTube. Platforms like
                YouTube were created a whole new way for user created content to be viewed. This brings us to a new
                generation of web 2.0.

                Platforms like Myspace allowed people all over the world to connect and most importantly (be seen).
                Facebook appeared shortly after where users grew so fast it created a whole new use of the internet.
                This growth is due to humans need for social growth. These desires for social acceptance and popularity
                have made these social platforms larger than companies such as IBM who have been around for decades.
                Companies such as Myspace and Facebook are making billions with just advertising on these platforms. The
                web continues to grow with more users and users spending more time online. The question remains what
                will the web bring next?
