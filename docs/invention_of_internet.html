                    The internet is a wide network that connects computers all over the world and is used for
                    information and communication. It is the telecommunication of the 21st century. Dated back to the
                    1950s the internet has grown rapidly and is accessible to anyone with an internet service provider.
                    There are more emails sent out in a day than first class letters via post office and is responsible
                    for 1/3 of the US economic growth in 1998. Back when computers first came around the were slow and
                    were the size of rooms, gradually computers became faster and smaller and can be used anywhere in
                    the world (PC).

            The person with the idea or “seed’ of computing came from a man named J.C.R. Licklider. Computers first
            began being worked on during the civil war by Advanced research project agency, who oversaw the space
            program which included computer science. At MIT Leonard Kleinrock started working on data transmission and
            is known for queuing theory which is a branch is operations research that has application in many fields and
            implemented two techniques

                    Later, in 1960 Robert (Bob) Taylors’ big new idea was time sharing. Time sharing is a method of
                    operations which includes many users with different programs interact with the main processing unit
                    of a larger scale digital computer. He wanted to build a network for one terminal to talk to all
                    machines (computers). After receiving the funds to work on this project he recruited Lawrence
                    (Larry) Roberts to build the fist network. In 1968 Larry recruited engineers to build the Advanced
                    Research Projects Agency computer net work the ARPANET what is called the internet now. This was
                    based on minicomputers or smaller computers called Interface Message Processor or IMPs and
                    revolution technology called package switching. The plan was to network for identical IMPs each one
                    to be attached to different main framed computers:

        </ul>
        <p>
            By April 1971, the ARPANET had 18 main frame computers hooked into the network. Emails and files were sent
            across the network. In October of 1972, the idea that took over the world (Computer Network) was
            demonstrated in Washington DC. Finally the Act of congress passed a bill that took this out of exclusiveness
            and into the public.
